    <u><h3>Application Information:</h3></u>
    <h3>
        The Remote Command Broadcast application showcases the power of websocket API which enables the servers to communicate with
        <br/>the client browser sessions and vice versa. This experimental web application helps you to send commands remotely from one
        <br/>of your machine's browser session (registered as MASTER) to several other machines sessions(registered as SLAVE).
        <br/>The user interface in action is your web browser on your machine which supports websockets.
        <br/>
        <br/>Play with this application by following the below steps:
        <br/>
        <br/>1) Register your web browser session as a SLAVE using a valid email id and a password. By registering as a SLAVE
        <br/>   The commands as invoked by the MASTER web browser session would be executed in the SLAVE sessions. You can register
        <br/>   as many SLAVE sessions as you want on different machines which you want to control remotely.
        <br/>
        <br/>2) Register one of your browser session as a MASTER using the same valid email id and password which was used while
        <br/>   registering the SLAVE sessions. This will allow to link up the MASTER session with all the SLAVE sessions registered
        <br/>   with the same email id. Please note that there can only be one MASTER session for every registered email Id.
